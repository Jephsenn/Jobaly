## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Job Detection
The application is **automatically watching your clipboard** for job URLs. Here's what happens:

1. **You browse jobs normally** on LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.
2. **When you copy a job URL** (Ctrl+C), the app instantly detects it
3. **Job is saved automatically** to your local database
4. **Dashboard updates in real-time** showing the new job
5. **You can save or dismiss** jobs directly from the dashboard

### Supported Platforms
✅ LinkedIn  
✅ Indeed  
✅ Glassdoor  
✅ Dice  
✅ Monster  
✅ ZipRecruiter  
✅ AngelList/Wellfound  
✅ Greenhouse  
✅ Lever

## 🧪 Test It Right Now!

### Try this example:
1. **Copy this LinkedIn job URL** (click to select, then Ctrl+C):
   ```
   https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3234567890/
   ```

2. **Look at your dashboard** - the job should appear within 1 second!

3. **Click "Save"** to mark it as saved, or **"Dismiss"** to hide it

## 🔒 Privacy & Compliance

### What the app DOES:
✅ Monitors your clipboard (local only)  
✅ Detects job URLs you manually copy  
✅ Stores everything locally (no cloud)  
✅ Never shares your data  
✅ Never auto-applies to jobs  

### What the app DOES NOT do:
❌ No web scraping or crawling  
❌ No automated form submission  
❌ No storing of passwords  
❌ No data sent to servers  
❌ No ToS violations  

This is **100% TOS-compliant** because you're just copy/pasting URLs normally!

3. All jobs appear in dashboard
4. Review them all at once and decide which to pursue

### Keep the App Running

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Jobs not appearing?
1. Make sure you copied the **full URL** (https://...)
2. Check it's from a supported platform
3. Look at the console logs (Help → Toggle Developer Tools)

- Check that the Electron window is focused
